# Design Elements

The rpmget package provides a convenient baseline configuration and
example for managing an arbitrary set of binary rpm packages with
optional support for creating the canonical rpm build tree and pkg
repository.

The primary runtime dependencies are httpx, tqdm, and cerberus, where
cerberus provides the runtime validation for the active configuration
data. Complete package dependencies are shown in the figure below:

## Design decisions

* flexible configuration format with baseline validation
* httpx download client with progress display
