### Validation Rules

In addition to the ConfigParser checks, all configurations should be checked
by the validate function using a simple validation schema and URL parsing
based on the following rules. See the default config for an example.

- the [rpmget] section must exist, any others are optional
- the [rpmget] section must contain at least the required keys
  - 'top_dir': the directory where rpms are downloaded
  - 'layout': either 'flat' (single directory) or 'tree'
  - 'pkg_tool': either 'rpm', 'yum', or 'dnf'
- the config must contain at least one valid URL string value ending with '.rpm'
