### Manifests and metadata

Instead of unconditionally (re)downloading each file every time, create
a JSON manifest file to track the downloaded rpm files in the active
configuration.

Candidate metadata items to track:

- associated config file name
- for each rpm file
  - file name
  - file mtime (download timestamp)
  - file digest, eg, sha256
  - file size

Suggested format is JSON, suggested location is under XDG user cache
directory.

- for each manifest file
  - use config file name with `.json` appended
  - save manifest file in XDG user cache directory
- use manifest to detect changes
- include manifest data in checks for file updates
